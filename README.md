## **Assignment Questions**

1. State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)
   A Database Management System (DBMS) typically includes components like:
   Database Engine - for storage and retrieval
   The Database Schema- this is the structure
   The Query Processor- SQL commands
   The Transaction Manager- it ensures data integrity
   The User Interface- used for interaction.

3. What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.
   A relational database organizes data into tables (or relations) with rows and columns, making it easy to access and manage data using SQL (Structured Query Language).

Four examples of relational databases are:
   MySQL
   PostgreSQL
   Microsoft SQL Server
   Oracle Database

5. State and Explain three classifications of SQL?
   Data Definition Language (DDL)- DDL commands are used to define and manage database structures such as tables, indexes, and schemas. They allow users to create, alter, and delete database objects.
   Data Manipulation Language (DML)- DML commands are used for managing data within the database objects. They allow users to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data.
   Data Control Language (DCL)- DCL commands are used to control access to data in the database. They allow users to grant and revoke permissions and privileges.

7. What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?
   A Primary Key uniquely identifies each record in a database table, ensuring no duplicate values, while a Foreign Key links a record in one table to the Primary Key in another table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.

9. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?
    An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the relationships between entities within a database. It shows how data is interconnected and structured, typically illustrating entities, attributes, and relationships.

11. What are the advantages of relational databases?
    Enhances data integrity
    Flexibility and Scalability
    Standardization
    Data security
    Data relation

13. State four types of data type used to store data in tables?
    Integer
    Date and time
    Variable character
    Boolean
   
15. What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)?
    The purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS) is to provide an efficient, convenient, and safe way to store, manage, and retrieve data. It handles data storage, retrieval, manipulation, and ensures data integrity, security, and consistency while allowing users and applications to access and interact with the database.
